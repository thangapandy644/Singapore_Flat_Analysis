# Singapore_Flat_Analysis

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

WorkFlow of Project:
Collecting a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date.

Data Preprocessing:

Overcoming Null values

Removing Noise data/Feature

Encoding the Categorical Columns using ordinal and one hot encoding

Handling skewness

All these process are done in Preprocessing of data and analysed.

Exploratory data Analysis:

The relationship between Resale Price and specific Features are analysed by plotting correlation.

Model Building

Evaluating Model

Saved the best fitted model using pickling

Developing Streamlit Web Application

Deploying the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
